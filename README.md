### ðŸ“– Key Features :
- **Animation Toggle**: Toggle Animation On/Off to visually see the process of sorting algorithms
- **Efficient vs Inefficient**: Compare 12 different sorting algorithms to see the effect on sorting efficiency in real time!
- **Number Range**: Change range of numbers to see if it has any effect on sorting algorithm efficiency
- **Columns**: Customise number of values being sorted in array of numbers. Helps to see sorting algorithms with small vs large quanity of elements
- **Time**: Slow down animations to your liking to understand exactly how it works with a visual demonstration
